	<h1 style="text-align:center;color:white"> I'm Nerevar :^]</h1>
	<br> <p> I'm 19, (20 on June 11 very exciting stuff). I have a lot of interests, so I've laid them out in a hopefully easy to observe format.</a> </p>
  <br> <h1 style="text-align:center;color:white"> Video Games</h1>
    <p>I also really like video games. My favorite video game ever is Morrowind if the name didn't give it away. I've played the last three mainline Elder Scrolls games plus ESO so I'm <i> KIND OF </i> what the kids would say an epic kirkbride lorebeard chim yellow blue funny. <br>
    <br> but, besides that, I'm also a big fan of Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, and the Sims games. I have probably 2000 hours in the Sims 2, with like 70 in the Sims 3 and then idk how many in the Sims 4 <br> but I imagine it's quite a bit (I don't know for sure because I DEFINITELY didn't obtain the game by not purchasing it. I own the Sims 4 origin teehee). I've played Minecraft on and off since like ~2011-2012. <br>
    <br> I've also played and really liked the Portal games, and Half Life. gmod is really fun also. I've started playing Dead by Daylight and I really like that game too!!

   <br> <h1 style="text-align:center;color:white"> Music </h1>
   <p> I had a whole thing written up but I just made a whole nother page for music (with a playlist included teehee) check it out <a href="music.html"> at this link :)</a> </p>
